Simple_Javascript_Quiz
======================

Master contains a simple quiz using jquery.  Branches will be used to play with more advanced javascript libraries and frameworks.  This first iteration only uses jquery.  All the html is loaded into the page at runtime and hidden as opposed to templating it out.  That will be done in other branches.
